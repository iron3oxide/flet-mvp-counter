# flet-mvp-counter

A simple showcase of how one could use [fletched](https://github.com/iron3oxide/fletched)
to build a simple, login-protected counter app.

Also showcases the client storage functionality (that's why the port is fixed,
otherwise no local storage would be found).
This enables you to continue counting right where you left off!

See it in action [here](https://mvp-counter.fly.dev/)

Feedback and PRs are welcome.
