# flet-mvp-counter

A simple showcase of how one could use the MVP pattern with Flet. 
Heavily inspired by [this project](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/2022-gui/tree/main/mvp) and the accompanying video.

Also showcases the client storage functionality (that's why the port is fixed, otherwise no local storage would be found).
This enables you to continue counting right where you left off!

Feedback and PRs are welcome.
